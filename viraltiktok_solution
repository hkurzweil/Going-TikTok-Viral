# üéµ Going Viral: Analyzing TikTok Success with Data Science

In this lesson, we'll explore what makes TikTok videos go viral using data science! We'll analyze real patterns in social media engagement and learn how to optimize content for better reach.
## üìö Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Installed libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Analyze TikTok engagement patterns using real data
- Understand the relationship between posting time and video success
- Identify which content categories perform best
- Learn how video characteristics affect engagement
- Create data-driven content strategies

## üìä Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
First, we'll examine our TikTok dataset which contains information about:

- Views, likes, comments, and shares
- Video duration
- Posting time
- Music usage
- Hashtag count
- Content category

```
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

# Enhanced dataset with categories
categories = ['Dance', 'Comedy', 'Tutorial', 'Lifestyle', 'Food', 'Gaming', 'Music', 'Fashion', 'Sports', 'News']
data = {
    'video_id': range(1, 101),
    'views': np.random.exponential(scale=100000, size=100),
    'likes': np.random.exponential(scale=20000, size=100),
    'comments': np.random.exponential(scale=1000, size=100),
    'shares': np.random.exponential(scale=5000, size=100),
    'duration_sec': np.random.uniform(5, 60, 100),
    'post_hour': np.random.randint(0, 24, 100),
    'has_music': np.random.choice([True, False], size=100, p=[0.8, 0.2]),
    'hashtag_count': np.random.randint(0, 8, 100),
    'category': np.random.choice(categories, size=100, p=[0.15, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1, 0.05])
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate engagement rate
df['engagement_rate'] = ((df['likes'] + df['comments'] + df['shares']) / df['views'] * 100).round(2)

print(df.head())
```

## üîç Key Metrics
We'll focus on these engagement metrics:

- Views
- Likes
- Comments
- Shares
- Engagement Rate (calculated as: (likes + comments + shares) / views * 100)

## üéØ Activities
### Activity 1: Time Analysis
Let's discover the best times to post on TikTok!
```
# Create a box plot of views by posting hour
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='post_hour', y='views', data=df)
plt.title('Views by Posting Hour')
plt.xlabel('Hour of Day (24-hour format)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Views')
plt.show()
```
Questions to Consider:

1. What patterns do you notice in viewing times?
2. When are engagement rates highest?
3. How might this affect your posting strategy?

### Activity 2: Category Analysis
Different types of content perform differently. Let's analyze which categories get the most engagement!
```
# Create a bar plot of engagement rates by category
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(x='category', y='engagement_rate', data=df)
plt.title('Engagement Rate by Content Category')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.ylabel('Average Engagement Rate (%)')
plt.show()
```

Discussion Points:

1. Which categories have the highest engagement rates?
2. Why might certain categories perform better?
3. How could this inform content strategy?

### Activity 3: Video Duration Analysis
Does video length matter? Let's find out!
```
# Create a scatter plot of duration vs engagement
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(df['duration_sec'], df['engagement_rate'], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Video Duration vs Engagement Rate')
plt.xlabel('Video Duration (seconds)')
plt.ylabel('Engagement Rate (%)')
plt.show()
```
Analysis Questions:

1. Is there an optimal video length?
2. How does duration affect different types of content?
3. What length would you recommend for your content?

### Activity 4: Correlation Analysis
Let's see how different metrics relate to each other.
```
# Create a correlation heatmap
correlation_matrix = df[['views', 'likes', 'comments', 'shares', 'duration_sec', 'hashtag_count']].corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', center=0)
plt.title('Correlation Between Different Metrics')
plt.show()
```
Think About:

1. Which metrics are most strongly correlated?
2. What insights can we draw from these relationships?
3. How could this inform content creation?

## üéÆ Interactive Challenge: Design Your TikTok!
Now it's your turn to apply what you've learned! Design your own TikTok video concept and see how it might perform.
Your video design should consider:

- Duration
- Number of hashtags
- Music usage
- Posting time
- Content category

```
def get_user_video_idea():
    print("\nüé• Let's design your TikTok video!")
    
    duration = float(input("How long will your video be (in seconds)? "))
    hashtags = int(input("How many hashtags will you use? "))
    has_music = input("Will your video have music? (yes/no) ").lower().startswith('y')
    hour = int(input("What hour will you post? (0-23) "))
    
    print("\nCategories:", ', '.join(categories))
    category = input("What category is your video? ").capitalize()
    
    return {
        'duration': duration,
        'hashtags': hashtags,
        'has_music': has_music,
        'hour': hour,
        'category': category
    }

video_idea = get_user_video_idea()
score = predict_success(**video_idea)
print(f"\nYour video score is: {score}/100")
```

## üìù Group Activities
### Team Challenges

1. Form teams and compete to create the highest-scoring video concept
2. Analyze real trending TikToks and compare them to our predictions
3. Create a presentation about why certain categories perform better
4. Design a marketing strategy based on the data analysis

Discussion Questions

1. Why do you think certain categories perform better than others?
2. How might these patterns change during different seasons or events?
3. What other factors might influence a video's success?
4. How could we improve our prediction model?

## üìà Extended Learning
