## 📚 Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Installed libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Analyze TikTok engagement patterns using real data
- Understand the relationship between posting time and video success
- Identify which content categories perform best
- Learn how video characteristics affect engagement
- Create data-driven content strategies

## 📊 Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
First, we'll examine our TikTok dataset which contains information about:

- Views, likes, comments, and shares
- Video duration
- Posting time
- Music usage
- Hashtag count
- Content category

```
# Load and examine the data
import pandas as pd
# Your code here to load the dataset
print(df.head())
```

## 🔍 Key Metrics
We'll focus on these engagement metrics:

- Views
- Likes
- Comments
- Shares
- Engagement Rate (calculated as: (likes + comments + shares) / views * 100)

## 🎯 Activities
### Activity 1: Time Analysis
Let's discover the best times to post on TikTok!
```
# Create a box plot of views by posting hour
# Your code here
```
Questions to Consider:

1. What patterns do you notice in viewing times?
2. When are engagement rates highest?
3. How might this affect your posting strategy?

### Activity 2: Category Analysis
Different types of content perform differently. Let's analyze which categories get the most engagement!
```
# Create a bar plot of engagement rates by category
# Your code here
```

Discussion Points:

1. Which categories have the highest engagement rates?
2. Why might certain categories perform better?
3. How could this inform content strategy?

### Activity 3: Video Duration Analysis
Does video length matter? Let's find out!
```
# Create a scatter plot of duration vs engagement
# Your code here
```
Analysis Questions:

1. Is there an optimal video length?
2. How does duration affect different types of content?
3. What length would you recommend for your content?

### Activity 4: Correlation Analysis
Let's see how different metrics relate to each other.
```
# Create a correlation heatmap
# Your code here
```
Think About:

1. Which metrics are most strongly correlated?
2. What insights can we draw from these relationships?
3. How could this inform content creation?
